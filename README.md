## Then vs Now  
This project started as a beginner friendly gallery powered by the Ghibli API. Since then, I’ve completely redesigned it, improved the code, and even applied Node.js. What sparked this update was the 2022 removal of the original Studio Ghibli API. Thanks to the Vercel Ghibli API, I was able to reuse much of my original logic while also being pushed to introduce new features and structure where needed, sometimes by choice, and sometimes out of necessity. However, after encountering persistent issues with CORS and proxy access, I rebuilt the project using a local JSON file to simulate API responses. The JSON file limited my styling for the time being, but my first design to this update is still within the style sheets, if I where to fetch with the local servers instead. You can see this referenced in the visuals provided below. 

✨ This transition reflects both the technical challenges I overcame and my growth in understanding how APIs, JSON, and local servers can interact in a frontend project.

## 💫 About the Project  
A film gallery that fetches data from the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.vercel.app/films) and displays it in a clean, yet whimsical, and responsive interface.

Users can:
- 🎬 Browse Ghibli films in a responsive grid  
- 🖱️ Click on a film for expanded details  
- 🖼️ Watch an animated banner slideshow featuring different movie banners

## 🌟 What’s New  
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 🌐 Outdated API | ✅ Updated with working endpoint & CORS fix |
| 🪞 Basic layout | ✨ Soft gradients, hover states & refined layout |
| ❌ Unresponsive | 📱 Fully mobile responsive |
| 🧵 Unstructured JS | 🧼 Clean, modular JS with comments |
| 🚫 No Node | 🌱 Used Node (still learning) |

---

## What I Learned  
- How to work with async/await and API fetch requests  
- How to fix CORS issues using proxies  
- DOM manipulation and clean JavaScript  
- More exposure to **Node.js** & test cases:  
   > I used Node to test things locally and troubleshoot CORS errors.

---

## Tech Stack  
- **HTML** – markup  
- **CSS** – styling
- **JavaScript** – behavior, fetch logic, DOM updates  
- **Node.js** – for local server setup & learning  
- **Hosted on:** Netlify
- **JSON** file used in place of live API for stability  
- **Powered by:** [Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.vercel.app/films)

## 🌱 Next Steps    
- Add film filters by year, director, or runtime  
- Try a dark to light toggle  
- Explore backend APIs or build my own Ghibli style mock API

# Studio-Ghibli-API-Project
## :purple_heart: :cherry_blossom: :dizzy: :star2: :sparkles: :purple_heart:

API project using the ghibliapi.heroku.app

:bulb: The inspiration for this project was to create a film gallery for Studio Ghibli that allows you to browse their films. This project uses the ghibli.heroku.app api. HTML for content, CSS for styling, and Javascript for behavior. 

:framed_picture: The project includes a banner slideshow that is timed to display a different film banner from Studio Ghibli. 

:pushpin: Users can also click on the film to learn more information. 

:art: The color pallete is a purple to pink gradient to capture the whimisical and dreamy aura alot of the Studio Ghibli films portray.
