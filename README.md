# Studio-Ghibli-API-Project

## :purple_heart: :cherry_blossom: :dizzy: :star2: :sparkles: :purple_heart:

API project using the ghibliapi.heroku.app

:bulb: The inspiration for this project was to create a film gallery for Studio Ghibli that allows you to browse their films. This project uses the ghibli.heroku.app api. HTML for content, CSS for styling, and Javascript for behavior. 

:framed_picture: The project includes a banner slideshow that is timed to display a different film banner from Studio Ghibli. 

:pushpin: Users can also click on the film to learn more information. 

:art: The color pallete is a purple to pink gradient to capture the whimisical and dreamy aura alot of the Studio Ghibli films portray.
